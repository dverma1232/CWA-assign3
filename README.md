# Creating Web Apps - Assignment 3
My third assignment for the creating web apps unit at uni. We had to add to the existing website from the <a href="https://github.com/dverma1232/assign2">previous assignment</a> and convert the website from HTML to PHP, add form validation using PHP and submit the form to a database. We also had to add a few new pages, one which would act as a receipt page, therefore it needed to take the info the user entered in payment.php, validate it and store it in a database and display the entered info on the receipt page. Another is the manager page, which would retrieve info saved in the database and display it in a table, also allowing the user to search/filter the results and also update and delete some orders. There were also a few extra enhancements I added, which included a login system which allows users to register, with their details being stored in a database and only registered/logged in users being able to access the manager page. Another enhancement I added was a data range on the search form in the manager page, which would allow the user to only show orders between certain dates chosen by them.
